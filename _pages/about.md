I recently receive a PhD in deep learning at Consevatoire national des arts et mÃ©tiers, Cnam, in Paris. My PhD was supervised by Nicolas Thome (Sorbonne UniversitÃ©), Nicolas Audebert (IGN) and ClÃ©ment Rambour (Cnam).
My PhD was co-financed by Coexya and my industrial supervisor was Xavier Bitot (Coexya).
I investigated deep learning approaches to image retrieval. Specifically, I worked on designing appropriate losses to train deep neural networks to optimize ranking losses. I also contributed on collaborative filtering recommendation using graph neural networks and on OOD detection using energy-based models.
During my PhD I have published three projects, ROADMAP at NeurIPS 2021, HAPPIER at ECCV 2022 and HEAT at ICML 2023. I have submitted an extension of ROADMAP and HAPPIER to TPAMI, which is under-review.
I am now actively looking for full-time or post-doc position, ideally starting at the end of the summer or in september.
