I am a PhD student in deep learning at Consevatoire national des arts et métiers, Le Cnam, in Paris. I am supervised by Nicolas Thome (Sorbonne Université), Nicolas Audebert (Le Cnam) and Clément Rambour (Le Cnam).
My thesis is co-financed by Coexya and my industrial supervisor is Xavier Bitot.
I investigate deep learning approaches to image retrieval. Specifically, I work on designing appropriate losses to train deep neural networks to optimize ranking losses. I also contributed on collaborative filtering recommendation using graph neural networks and on OOD detection using energy-based models. I have started my PhD in January 2021 and it will end in January 2024.
I have published three projects, ROADMAP at NeurIPS 2021, HAPPIER at ECCV 2022 and HEAT at ICML 2023.
