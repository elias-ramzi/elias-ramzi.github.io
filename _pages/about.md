I am PhD student at Le Cnam (in Paris) in deep learning supervised by Nicolas Thome (Sorbonne Université), Nicolas Audebert (Le Cnam) and Clément Rambour (Le Cnam).
My thesis is co-financed by Coexya and my industrial supervisor is Xavier Bitot.
I use deep learning for Context Based Image Retrieval. I have started my PhD in January 2021 and it will end in January 2024.
I have published two projects, ROADMAP at NeurIPS 2021 and HAPPIER at ECCV 2022.
