title: "Optimization of Rank Losses for Image Retrieval"

permalink: /publication/2024-01-01-suprank
excerpt: "In image retrieval, standard evaluation metrics rely
on score ranking, e.g. average precision (AP), recall at k (R@k),
normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). In this work we
introduce a general framework for robust and decomposable rank
losses optimization. It addresses two major challenges for end-to-end
training of deep neural networks with rank losses: non-differentiability
and non-decomposability. Firstly we propose a general surrogate for
ranking operator, SupRank, that is amenable to stochastic gradient
descent. It provides an upperbound for rank losses and ensures robust
training. Secondly, we use a simple yet effective loss function to reduce
the decomposability gap between the averaged batch approximation of
ranking losses and their values on the whole training set. We apply our
framework to two standard metrics for image retrieval: AP and R@k.
Additionally we apply our framework to hierarchical image retrieval.
We introduce an extension of AP, the hierarchical average precision
H-AP, and optimize it as well as the NDCG. Finally we create the first
hierarchical landmarks retrieval dataset. We use a semi-automatic
pipeline to create hierarchical labels, extending the large scale Google
Landmarks v2 dataset. The hierarchical dataset is publicly available
at [github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark). Code will be released
at [github.com/elias-ramzi/SupRank](https://github.com/elias-ramzi/SupRank).<br/><img src='/images/figure_intro_tpami.png'>"
